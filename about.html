      Air Gudu develops tools that make it easier for individuals, professionals, and organisations
      to exploit and understand atmospheric data available today. Our mission is to help users
      interpret our rapidly changing atmosphere and apply this knowledge across multiple fields,
      from air pollution and climate change to insurance, renewable energy, agriculture, tourism,
      and aviation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We offer a range of solutions, from Python scripts for advanced users to intuitive executables
      for those who simply want to generate maps, animations, time series, or tailored results without
      programming skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our products are designed to make complex atmospheric and meteorological data accessible and
      actionable, enabling better analysis, interpretation, and decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Air Gudu also has an educational component: we provide tutorials and guidance to help users
      understand what atmospheric variables mean, how to use them effectively, and where to access
      the data. Additionally, we release selected freeware tools in simplified versions, allowing
      users to try our software before exploring the full professional features.
    </p>
    <p>
      By combining science, technology, and accessibility, Air Gudu empowers users to turn invisible
      data into knowledge, awareness, and impact.
